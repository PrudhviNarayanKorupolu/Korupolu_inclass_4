        "In topic modeling, LSA is used to create a matrix with terms and documents.Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a process that takes the text of a document and categorizes it according to a specific topic. This procedure does not output the same documents as LSA. To find the optimal number of topics in multiple LDA models, the one with the highest coherence value is selected. Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation are commonly used for dealing with NLP issues. They can be easily seen in the output. The simplest way to implement LSA is by combining the document term matrix decomposition with the algorithm. It produces better results than LDA in terms of accuracy, simplicity, and speed. In addition, it uses the term frequency instead of the word count to determine the weights. "
